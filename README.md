Welcome to my submissison for the front end take home test for Future! I'm super thankful
for this oppoturnity and excited as well. 

1. To run the app, run 'npm start' in your terminal.

2. I did not put too much effort into styling or design into this app because it was not a part
of the prompt. I focused on more of the code and functionality. I added random colors to be able to easily differentiate the key parts of the project (List, Filters, and details).
I usually like to use styled-components for styling but I am open to any diffrent 
ways at Future. 

3. Due to time constraints, I was only able to finish the required portion and the first two points of 
the optional tasks. 

4. Hope you enjoy and I look forward to hearing from you soon! Thank you!
